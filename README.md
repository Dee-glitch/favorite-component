In this react application
* I fetch and render products from an API
* A user has an overview of all the products with the status 'available online'
* A user can 'favorite' a product by clicking on the heart icon
* The favorited products are rendered on another page so the user can access easily them
* The favorited products are also saved in the local storage meaning the data will persist even after refreshing
* User can delete the products they nolonger want in their favorite list
