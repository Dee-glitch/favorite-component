This is a small application utilizing react and react-router-dom that renders all the frames that are available in the online stores from the ace&tate API. The user can add any product that they like to their favorites through clicking on the white heart icon next to the product name, the heart will then turn red to visibly show that the product has been favorited. The product will then be added to the user's favoriteList which list they can access through clicking on the "favorites" link in the header. The can go ahead and remove the product from their favorites list but clicking on the red heart icon, which will remove the product from the list. the favorites are also stored in local storage, meaning that the user will not lose their list when the page refreshes
